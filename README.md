### Coral gem 

This gem is simply a meta package that installs and requires the CORL gem.

Note:  CORL is still early in development!

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION YET!!

Now you get to hear the story of two names.

Short story first;  We switched to the CORL name (http://github.com/coralnexus/corl).

If your interested in why:

The original name of the CORL project was Coral, and we were excited when we found 
the Ruby gem name "coral" available.  Our first versions of our CORL system were
named coral_core, coral_cloud, coral_vagrant, coral_plan, and many more were planned.
We created a meta gem (this one) to install a core combination of gems.  

During the course of development we found another project that came before ours that 
uses the name coral, so we decided to update our project name, so as to avoid conflicts.

For us Coral is more than a word, it is a concept that embodies dynamic ecosystems 
supporting a rich variety of lifeforms.  Coral are very interesting creatures and we
endeavor to create software that helps build dynamic ecosystems of digital creatures.

We decided to use an acronym that sounds like the word Coral because the acronym fit
with our desire to create something good for administration but also good for flexible
research, so we came to Cluster Orchestration and Research Library.  We split the core
components out into a small concurrent plugin framework called Nucleon, upon which
CORL is built.  All of our coral sub gems are integrated into these two.

This gem exists only as a installer for people who accidentally spell coral the right
way when trying to install the CORL system.  Use the CORL gem instead.
